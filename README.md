# TEST-projects-1

Hi, this is the github repository to test our collaboration workflow
 
Project folder hierarchy:
+ `TEST-projects-1` is the main project folder that contains subfolder for specific sub-projects
+ A `packrat` folder with defining the shared/common library for both sub-projects
+ the file `0-packrat-initialize.R` that has been created by Filippo Ferrario at the beginning to initialize the library
